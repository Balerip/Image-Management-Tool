# 🖼️ Image Management Tool

A **JavaFX-powered desktop application** that simplifies image organization, conversion, and metadata inspection — built with strong Object-Oriented principles and clean UI design.

---

## ✨ Overview

This project demonstrates end-to-end desktop development with **JavaFX**, **ImageIO**, and optional **ImageMagick/JMagick** integration.  
It focuses on **intuitive image handling**, **efficient conversion**, and **clear code structure** backed by **design patterns**.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🧭 Modern JavaFX GUI
- Upload image files from your local system  
- View 100×100 pixel thumbnails for quick previews  
- Display key image properties (height, width, camera info, GPS metadata, etc.)

### ⚙️ Image Processing & Conversion
- Convert images between multiple formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.)  
- Integration-ready with ImageIO / ImageMagick / JMagick  
- Download converted images directly within the app  

### 🧩 Design Patterns
- Implements at least one **design pattern** for modular and maintainable architecture  
- Encourages **separation of concerns** and clean component interaction  

### 🧱 Robust Object-Oriented Design
- Uses **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **interfaces** effectively  
- Clearly documented and easy to extend  

### 🖼️ Screenshot Gallery
- Contains test screenshots showing major features and scenarios  

### 🧯 Exception Handling & Documentation
- Graceful error handling  
- Clear inline comments and JavaDoc documentation  

### 🎨 (Optional) Filters & Effects
- Apply simple effects like grayscale, tints, or color filters *(if enabled)*
